# Nested_MIMD_SIMD

This codebase provides two examples of Nested MIMD-SIMD Parallelism as described in:

Gerzhoy, D., Sun, X., Zuzak, M., and Yeung, D. "Nested MIMD-SIMD Parallelization for Heterogeneous Microprocessors." ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization. Published December 2019.

The two example benchmarks are MD and FFT6 from the openmp source code repository.

These benchmarks are edited to launch their inner loops as kernels onto the GPU.

In order to have a low-latency kernel launch, the GPU launch mechanism for each benchmark is adapted from:

Michael Mrozek and Zbigniew Zdanowicz. 2016. GPU daemon: Road to zero cost submission. In Proceedings of the
4th International Workshop on OpenCL.

Rather than launching an OpenCL kernel every time we want to do work on the GPU. A "daemon" kernel is launched when the benchmark begins that polls a communication buffer, waiting to be given work. When we want to do work on the GPU, we write which threadblocks we want to execute into the communication buffer, and the daemon kernel executes the work.

# Benchmarks

In this repository we have 7 benchmarks.

# Hardware Requirements

CPU with Integrated GPU (code is written for Intel, but AMD should work as well with some edits) with OpenCL 2.0 capability.

OpenCL Shared Virtual memory (SVM) with "Fine-Grain SVM System" for atomics is required.

The specific SDK you install depends highly on your system and is thus out of the scope of this document.

This is but one example for an Intel processor:

# File Descriptions

## Common Directory
    clBuffer.h
        This file provides a templates for interacting with SVM buffers in a convenient way.
        Simplifies accessing elements in 1D and 2D arrays, and provides interface for binding arguments to kernels.
    clSetup.[h|cpp]
        clSetup provides the means for starting OpenCL, selecting a platform (your hardware and installed openCL SDK), 
        allocating queues, compiling kernels, and important global buffers.
    utils.[h|cpp]
        Provides some utility functions including file IO for the kernel files, and timers for recording performance.
	EventStats.[h|cpp]
		Some openCL event handling functions.
	kernel.[h|cpp]
		Kernel argument structure

## Benchmark Directory

Each benchmark contains not only the normal files the benchmark is implemented in (e.g. MD.cpp, fft6.cpp) but also a
custom (per benchmark) structure CL_Buffers_t defined in the commBuffer.[h|cpp] files (save for 367.imagick which has 
this code embedded in magick_resize.cpp).


    commBuffer.[h|cpp] 
        CL_Buffers_t is used first to hold/manage SVM pointers.
            Any parameters to the GPU kernel must be SVM pointers, so that they can be updated any time a low-latency launch is desired.

        Some benchmark specific non-GPU arrays and variables are also kept in this structure for convenience.

        The structure also defines several functions that setup the low-latency launch system (daemon), and schedule (launch) kernels to it.
    
    Kernels.cl
        This file contains the GPU launch daemon, which is a wrapper around the actual GPU kernel we wish to execute on the GPU.

# Reconstructing SPEC Benchmarks

Because of copyright and distribution issues, we cannot provide our full altered SPEC benchmarks.
Thus in each of the SPEC benchmark directories there are no source files included.

Instead, there is a patch file e.g. 372.smithwa.Nested_372_smithwa.omp2012.v1.0.tar.xz

This was created using SPEC2012's makesrcalt utility.

Thus you must have a copy of SPEC OMP 2012 (and SPEC OMP 2001 for 330.art) in order to reconstruct these benchmarks.

Reconstruction is achieved using a provided script in each spec benchmark directory:
    e.g. reconstruct_372_smithwa.sh

Instructions for its use are in the header of these scripts, but generally:

    source reconstruct_script.sh <SPEC_ROOT_PATH> <PATH TO DUMP SRC> <PATCH_PATH>

e.g.
    source reconstruct_372_smithwa.sh $SPEC ./ 372.smithwa.Nested_372_smithwa.omp2012.v1.0.tar.xz

Note that the script must be sourced and the second two options are optional, with defaults in the current directory.

# Compiling

cd << benchmark_directory >>
make

# Running

Each benchmark directory has a runall.sh script that shows how to run the kernel.
./runall.sh
